Home Assistant integration for [SensorPush temperature and humidity/hygrometer sensors](https://www.amazon.com/SensorPush-Wireless-Thermometer-Hygrometer-Android/dp/B01AEQ9X9I?tag=rynoshark-20).

NOTE:

* If you register a new physical sensor with SensorPush, you must restart Home Assistant to discover the new device(s).

*  Ideally SensorPush sensors would be located within range of a [SensorPush G1 WiFi Gateway](https://www.amazon.com/SensorPush-G1-WiFi-Gateway-Anywhere/dp/B01N17RWWV?tag=rynoshark-20) for continuously collecting and publishing data from the sensors to the SensorPush cloud. However, SensorPush sensors can also synchronize historical data over Bluetooth when nearby an iOS or Android device with the SensorPush app).

## Support

If you have trouble with installation and configuration, visit the [SensorPush Home Assistant community discussion](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/sensorpush-humidity-and-temperature-sensors/105711).

This integration was developed to cover use cases for my home integration and released as a contribution to the community. Implementing new features beyond what exists is the responsibility of the community to contribute.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Custom Components

Mkae sure [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs) is installed,  then add the "Integration" repository: *rsnodgrass/hass-sensorpush*.

Note: Manual installation by direct download and copying is not supported. If you have issues, please first try installing this integration with HACS.

#### Versions

The 'master' branch of this custom component is considered unstable, alpha quality, and not guaranteed to work.
Please make sure to use one of the official release branches when installing using HACS, see [what has changed in each version](https://github.com/rsnodgrass/hass-sensorpush/releases).

### Step 2: Enable API Access

If you've never accessed the [SensorPush Gateway account dashboard](https://beta.sensorpush.com) you must log in once and agree to the terms to allow the integration to access your SensorPush account. (If you've done this any time in the past, you may skip this step.) If you see errors in your log stating `[pysensorpush] Could not authenticate to SensorPush service with <your_email> and password`, and you've checked to ensure your credentials are correct, you probably need to do this.

### Step 3: Configure SensorPush

Example configuration.yaml entry:

```yaml
sensorpush:
  username: your@email.com
  password: your_password

sensor:
  - platform: sensorpush
```

#### Lovelace

![Lovelace Example](https://github.com/rsnodgrass/hass-sensorpush/blob/master/docs/sensorpush-entities.png?raw=true)

```yaml
entities:
  - entity: sensor.warehouse_humidity
  - entity: sensor.warehouse_temperature
show_header_toggle: false
title: SensorPush
type: entities
```

Lovelace gauge example:

```yaml
entity: sensor.warehouse_humidity
max: 100
min: 0
name: Office
severity:
  green: 45
  red: 15
  yellow: 25
theme: Backend-selected
type: gauge
```

More complex example using mini-graph-card and color thresholds:

![Lovelace Example](https://github.com/rsnodgrass/hass-sensorpush/blob/master/docs/sensorpush-graph.png?raw=true)

```yaml
cards:
  - color_thresholds:
      - color: '#00ff00'
        value: 0
      - color: '#abf645'
        value: 30
      - color: '#FFD500'
        value: 50
      - color: '#ff0000'
        value: 60
    decimals: 0
    entities:
      - entity: sensor.warehouse_humidity
        name: Humidity
    font_size: 75
    hours_to_show: 12
    line_color: blue
    line_width: 8
    points_per_hour: 2
    show:
      fill: true
      icon: false
    type: 'custom:mini-graph-card'
  - color_thresholds:
      - color: '#abf645'
        value: 0
    decimals: 0
    entities:
      - entity: sensor.warehouse_temperature
        name: Temperature
    font_size: 75
    hours_to_show: 12
    line_color: var(--accent-color)
    line_width: 8
    points_per_hour: 2
    show:
      icon: false
    type: 'custom:mini-graph-card'
type: horizontal-stack
```

#### Tracking Battery

The battery level of sensors are attributes on each sensor, a separate sensor is not provided. However, if you wish to track battery levels, you can add a template sensor.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      fridge_sensor_battery_voltage:
        friendly_name: 'Fridge SensorPush battery voltage'
        unit_of_measurement: 'V'
        value_template: '{{ state_attr("sensor.fridge_humidity", "battery_voltage") }}'
```

## Hardware Requirements

* [SensorPush Wireless Thermometer/Hygrometer - Humidity & Temperature Smart Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/SensorPush-Wireless-Thermometer-Hygrometer-Android/dp/B01AEQ9X9I?tag=rynoshark-20)
* [SensorPush G1 WiFi Gateway](https://www.amazon.com/SensorPush-G1-WiFi-Gateway-Anywhere/dp/B01N17RWWV?tag=rynoshark-20)

## Known Issues

## Future Enhancements

* merge this into the Home Assistant core (requires someone to contribute a config_flow)

#### Out of Scope

No plans to implement the following at this time:

* determine if the following devices work with SensorPush (all were tested/approved the same day, with same internal designs), but these may require a custom firmware flash:
